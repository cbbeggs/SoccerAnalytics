Soccer analytics: an introduction with R repository

Clive Beggs (16th January 2024)

The files contained in the SoccerAnalytics repository accompany the book ‘Soccer analytics: an introduction using R’ by Clive Beggs. There are two types of file in the repository, R code files and csv data files. The code files contain the R code for the examples in the book and are named according to the various chapters, while the csv files contain the data used by the R code in the examples. There are eleven R code files, one for each chapter of the book, and these should run automatically in RStudio. The data required to run the example codes is contained in the csv files.

The R code and csv files should be copied onto the users hard disk, with the csv files stored in a directory where they can be accessed by the R code. In the example codes, it is assumes that the csv data files are located in a directory called ‘Datasets’.
